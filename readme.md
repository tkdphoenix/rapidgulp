#Rapid Gulp
This is a video course by Packt Publishing that I studied to help me to integrate Gulp into my workflow. 

In the code folder there are directories for each lesson. Each directory has a short description of what can be found in there.

I put my own work on the root folder and left the practice code as is, since all examples were completed to begin with. I ignored the node_module directory since it gets very complex, and npm will install these packages and dependencies as needed when you run 
```
npm install <package-name>
```
The gulpfile.json file is a final file that I am using for minifying CSS, combining and compressing JS and making changes to the page appear instantly when the code page is saved.
